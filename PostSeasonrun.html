<p style="color:red;font-size:24px;"> The Post-season run for the Redsox was a breeze.</p>
<p style="color:red;font-size:24px;"> Their first opponent was the New York Yankees, who they went on to beat 3-1 in a best of 5 series.</p>
<p style="color:red;font-size:24px;"> Their second opponent, in the American League Championship series was the Houston Astros, who they went on to beat 4-1 in a best of 7 series.</p>
<p style="color:red;font-size:24px;"> Their final opponent, who they played in the World Series, was the Los Angeles Dodgers, they went on to win that series 4-1 in a best of 7 series.</p>
<p style="color:red;font-size:24px;"> The Redsox were able to put up a dominant showing without some of their key players, some of those players are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dustin Pedroia, who has missed considerable time with a bad knee.</li>
<li>David Wright, a knuckleballer who has had a lot of struggles with shoulder pain in the passed couple of years.</li>
<li>Tyler Thornburg, a hard throwing reliever who had been dealing with elbow pain throughout the year.</li>
<p style="color:red;font-size:24px;"> Despite the absence of those players, they still were able to be in complete control in each series they played in.</p>
